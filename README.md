# Palindrome Checker

I built this palindrome checker to get my hands back on coding

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) Certification

I really enjoyed styling and building the logic for this challenge, you can find it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker).
